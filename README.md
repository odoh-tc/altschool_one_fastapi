Created a FastAPI project with the following specifications:
 - A Student resource. 
 Each student will have:
  - Id (int)
  - Name(str)
  - Age (int)
  - Sex (str)
  - Height (float)
For data storage, I useD an in-memory storage (Python dictionary)
Created endpoints to do the following:
- Create a Student resource
- Retrieve a Student resource (one Student and many Students)
- Update a Student resource
- Delete a Student resource
